          Hey there! My name is Bozhidar and I've never thought that my name and
          "developer" would be used in the same sentence. However it turned out
          that I really enjoy writing code in Angular. It all started almost
          like a joke in the beginning of 2023, but a few JS courses later I
          found out that this is really something I love to do and it can bring
          out my creative side. My last course was Angular based, so I started
          exploring it deeper and so far I've made a few projects based on it.
          They're listed in chronological order and I hope that each and every
          new one will be better than the previous. I am looking forward to
          improving my skills and learning new technologies, as one can never
          know too much, escpecially in the IT world!
